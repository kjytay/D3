## Short Description of Examples  

1. **(jQuery, Flot)** Line chart with an interactive legend that allows user to select which charts he wants displayed. (Have not figured out how to put legend on right side of chart and how to have each category on a line of its own.)
2. **(jQuery, Flot, Flot's selection plug-in)** Line chart with zoom interactivity. User can click and drag out a rectangle; upon letting go the chart will zoom into the rectangle selected. There is a "reset zoom" buttom to reset the chart.
