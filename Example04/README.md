Loading data from a .csv file to create a line graph.

## How to run this example

Note that web browsers (at least Chrome) may not allow the d3 script to load local .csv files directly.

To get around this:

1. In Terminal, navigate to the folder where `index.html` resides.
2. Type `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888 &`.
3. In the web browser, go to the URL `http://localhost:8888/index.html`.
