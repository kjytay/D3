# D3
This repository contains examples I have gathered which have helped me learn D3.

- [This website](http://www.jeromecukier.net/blog/2012/09/04/getting-to-hello-world-with-d3/) was very helpful in getting started in the first place (things like setting up a text editor, html & css files, etc.)
- I found the w3schools' [SVG Tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/svg/) very helpful in understand the basics of SVG.
- [Dashing D3.js](https://www.dashingd3js.com/) has a pretty good tutorial for D3.
